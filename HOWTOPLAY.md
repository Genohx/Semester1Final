# The Defense of Rowan Kingdom
Description:

My game has the player defeating 5 slimes with their spells before fighting a boss.

How to Play:

First enter your name. Type 1 to cast icebolt, dealing 2 damage and generating 20 mana. Type 2 to cast fireball, dealing 4 damage
and using 20 mana. Type 3 to cast explosion, only castable at 100 mana and dealing 8 damage. This attack consumes all your mana. Type 4
to use a potion, healing the player for 30 health. The player has a 30% chance to critical on not only their attacks, but on health potions
as well. Criticals deal double damage and heal double the normal amount.

Interesting Features:

The player as well as the slimes level up, increasing the player health and mana by 10 each level, and increasing slime health by 5 each
level.

When cast above 100 mana, explosion becomes empowered and deals 24 damage(48 on critical hits!)
